## Introduction

### What is Data Analytics

Data analytics is the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making. It involves various techniques and tools to analyze raw data and derive insights that can be used for improving business processes, making strategic decisions, and gaining a competitive edge.

### Types of Data Analytics

Data analytics can be categorized into four main types, each serving a different purpose and providing different insights:

1. Descriptive Analytics. Summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. Includes basic statistical measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and pie charts. Understanding what has happened over a given period of time. For example, reporting on monthly sales figures or website traffic statistics.

2. Diagnostic Analytics: Understanding why something happened by examining data more deeply. Involves data mining, correlation analysis, and drill-down techniques to uncover patterns and relationships. For example, identifying the reasons behind a decline in sales or an increase in customer churn.

3. Predictive Analytics. Forecast future events based on historical data. Utilizes machine learning algorithms, statistical models, and predictive modeling techniques such as regression analysis, time series analysis, and classification. For example, predicting future sales trends, customer behavior, or potential risks. For example, predicting which customers are likely to purchase a product.

4. Prescriptive Analytics. Recommend actions based on the analysis and predictions. Combines predictive models with optimization algorithms and decision analysis to suggest the best course of action. For example, recommending inventory levels, optimizing supply chain operations, or personalizing marketing campaigns. For example, suggesting the best pricing strategy for maximizing revenue.

Each type of data analytics builds on the previous one, adding more depth and value to the insights gained from the data. Together, they provide a comprehensive approach to understanding and leveraging data for better decision-making.
